I'm Jake, and I like low level development. Programming by day, trying but failing to sleep by night.

Maybe a blog will come someday, I'm not sure. Contact me at `jake [dot] stbu [at] gmail [dot] com`

I do:

- C
- x86_64 Assembly
- Learning Rust
- Python for tiny scripts
- Anything that I feel like learning at the time

I use:

- OS: Arch Linux
- Window manager: i3wm
- Terminal emulator: Alacritty
- TUI WM: tmux
- Code editor: Vim
- Shell: zsh

I've written:

- An x86_64 OS kernel from scratch
- A compiler from scratch (targetting 64 bit NASM assembly)
- A PDP-8 emulator
- Various machine learning projects
- A search engine from scratch
