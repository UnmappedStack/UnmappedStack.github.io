<h1>These are the worse GitHub issues I've ever gotten.</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve written a fair few hobby projects by now, both collaborative and personal ones, but no matter what it is or who I&#39;m working on it with, there seems to always be one thing in common: dumb issues.</p>
<p>I mean I guess it makes sense. GitHub isn&#39;t exactly filled only with professionals, even if that&#39;s the larger part of it. There&#39;s a ton of script kiddies, people who just wanna get into the contributor lists (yes, I&#39;m talking about those README typo editors and space adders...), and of course, the people who think that every project has to change the world to be worth it. Anyway enough of my rambling, here&#39;s a few of the funniest ones in my opinion:</p>

<h2 id="1-the-revolutionary">1. The revolutionary</h2>
<p>This one is from last year in 2024, when I got a kind fellow saying that my project was pointless. This was actually an issue on the repo of my first ever OS development project, <a href="https://github.com/UnmappedStack/SpecOS">SpecOS</a>: </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://unmappedstack.dev/assets/revolutionary.png" alt="A screenshot of the issue">
</p>
<p>I actually <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/osdev/comments/1eo2ztb/shouldve_made_specos_revolutionary_so_this_guy/">posted this on reddit</a> and got a fair bit of support given it&#39;s such a small community - you can see all the people arguing for me in the comments lol (if you&#39;re one of those people, I hold you to the highest respect :P). </p>

<h2 id="2-the-ai-abuser">2. The AI abuser</h2>
<p>This one is actually from somebody I had talked to previously on Discord. He was some 15 year old telling us about how he wrote his website only with AI and couldn&#39;t code. Okay, I won&#39;t judge. Do what you want.</p>
<p>But my problem was more that he was being cocky about it. Like, he was claiming to be some sort of genius because he was able to tell AI to do something. He labelled his complaining to ChatGPT that it&#39;s not working as &quot;debugging&quot;. Nope. No. Uh-uh. Don&#39;t devalue my real debugging with your complains to a bot!</p>
<p>Anyway, he later found my repo and decided to accuse <em>me</em> of writing my OS with AI. Now I can tell you, I haven&#39;t used AI for <a href="https://github.com/UnmappedStack/TacOS">TacOS</a> (the project which he posted the issue on - also my latest OS development project that you should check out, it runs Doom!!!). But, apparently our conversation got him angry so he decided to inquire about it: </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://unmappedstack.dev/assets/ai-abuser.png" alt="A screenshot of the second issue">
</p>
<p>The initial claim is already a bit odd. Just zero context, nothing but a title? Okay. I asked for a little reasoning, and he asked me for... wait what??? He wants a <strong>
        <em>video recording of me typing out the codebase on my keyboard</em>
    </strong>??? Why would I have just happened to have been recording that??? And, despite me having asked for some specific code that looks AI generated and why, he just left that out completely. Okay mate, sure. </p>

<h2 id="3-this-isn-t-under-a-permissive-enough-license">3. tHiS iSn&#39;T uNdEr a pErMisSivE eNouGh liCenSe</h2>
<p>I tend to license everything under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) 2.0. It&#39;s fairly copyleft, but it has a few boundaries for commercial use, such as not allowing it to be used in trademarked works. Personally, I like it. This guy didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://unmappedstack.dev/assets/bsd-lover.png" alt="A screenshot of the third issue">
</p>
<p>BSD is great and all, but I get the feeling he&#39;s never actually read or looked at the MPL 2.0. It&#39;s <em>really not strong</em>, but he seems to think it is. Oh well. This one isn&#39;t as funny as the others but I still find it kinda entertaining. Anyway this one was on <a href="https://github.com/bikeshed-browser/browser">Bikeshed</a>, a browser with it&#39;s own from-scratch web engine that myself and a few other guys work on. </p>
